# Applied-Machine-Learning-Ensemble-methods

Welcome to my hands-on heterogenous ensemble practice where I try to immerse myself in applied machine learning in Python.
I explore heterogenous ensemble models(stacking). Using `sklearn.ensemble` method in scikit learn, we create bespoke layers that are stacking-ready.

The Basis of model stacking:

* Create various types of baseline models, including linear and logistic regression using Scikit-Learn, for comparison to ensemble methods.
* Build layers, then stack them up.
* Calculate and visualize performance metrics.
